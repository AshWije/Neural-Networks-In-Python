# Neural Networks in Python

This repository includes the implementation of six neural networks designed for four
different data sets either using the PyTorch library, the TensorFlow library or written
from scratch.

The neural networks are either standard neural networks (NNs) or convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The data sets used are MNIST, MNIST-fashion, CIFAR-10, and a modified version of ImageNet.

This is done in order to better understand how to design NNs and CNNs to appropriately
match data sets and how to achieve high accuracies.
