# With TensorFlow

This folder contains the implementation of two convolutional neural networks designed
for the MNIST-fashion data set and for the CIFAR-10 data set both written using the
TensorFlow library.

The results and model details are shown in comment blocks at the top of each file.

A brief description for each file:


**MNIST-fashion CNN**
Creates a convolutional neural network model in TensorFlow designed for
the MNIST-fashion data set reduced to 6,000 images and shrunk to size 7x7.

More details regarding the model can be found in the file *MNISTFashion_CNN.py*.


**CIFAR-10 CNN**
Creates a convolutional neural network model in TensorFlow designed for
the CIFAR-10 data set with a limited time frame.

More details regarding the model can be found in the file *CIFAR_CNN.py*.
